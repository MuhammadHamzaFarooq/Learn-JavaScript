            The Geometrizer
            Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle, using
            the definitions here.
            Create a function called calcCircumference:
            • Pass the radius to the function.
            • Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output
            "The circumference is NN".
            Create a function called calcArea:
            • Pass the radius to the function.
            • Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area
            is NN".
            Circumference of circle = 2πr
            Area of circle = πr2
